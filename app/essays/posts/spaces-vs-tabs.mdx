## Being a productive CS Student

### Gain Experience Before Applying for Jobs

**"Do the job before you apply for it."** Build personal projects, contribute to clubs, and showcase your work publicly. Employers value proof of skills over just a degree.

### Understand How Your Company Makes Money

As a **Software Engineer**, your differentiation comes from **business knowledge**. Learn how your company generates revenue and how your **team's work contributes to that**. Prioritizing tasks with business impact will make you appear **highly productive**.

For example, during **onboarding**, don’t waste time reading **all** documentation—**use business knowledge** to identify the most critical sections that will help you contribute faster.

### Take Control of Your Education

Your academic advisor is there to **help**, but **don’t rely on them entirely**. To get the most out of **Drexel**, you have to take initiative and craft your own academic and career path.

### Be Prepared for Programming Assignments

Programming assignments **always take longer than expected**—usually **2-3x longer**. Plan accordingly and start early.

### Under promise and Overdeliver

When estimating how long something will take, **give yourself extra time for debugging**. This applies both to personal projects and work deadlines.

### Develop an Efficient Learning Strategy

With **Drexel’s quarter system**, courses move **fast**. You need a **highly effective and quick learning strategy** to keep up.

### Personal Projects Take More Time Than You Expect

Expect personal projects to take **10x longer than you initially anticipate**, especially if you're trying to do them at a **high level**. If you're not willing to **temporarily drop everything** to focus on it, it’s probably not worth starting.

### Limit Your Core Focuses

In life, you can **only have 2-3 core focuses** at any given time—ideally **just one**. Everything else should be **minimum effort**.

- **School or work is one by default.**
- Outside of that, commit to at most **1-2 extracurriculars** with regular meetings and deliverables.
- As your classes get harder, your **free time decreases exponentially**, so you need to focus your energy on just **one** thing at a time.

### The Rewards Go to the Top 1%

Success in most fields follows a **power law distribution**—the **top 1%** get **99% of the rewards**, while the bottom **99% compete for scraps**. If you spread yourself too thin across multiple things, **don’t expect to reach a high level in any of them**.

Trying to juggle too many commitments will likely lead to **burnout**. Instead, **focus deeply** on what truly matters, and you’ll achieve far greater success.

## How to Be a Happy CS Major

### Prioritize Mental Health

Looking back, I wish I had taken my mental health more seriously in college and avoided the **all-or-nothing** mindset. Sahil Bloom, in his latest book [The 5 Types of Wealth](https://www.the5typesofwealth.com/), discusses the concept of **"dimmer switches"**—not everything has to be at 100% intensity all the time. Finding balance is key.
### Separate Career Talk from Social Life

At **Drexel**, relationships can sometimes feel transactional. Set clear boundaries between discussions about **internships, LeetCode, and careers** versus **casual and fun topics**. Your **mind** will drive your career success, but **turning it off** will help you build meaningful friendships and avoid overthinking social interactions.

### Own Your Choices and Accept Tradeoffs

Many people blame external factors instead of working on themselves. **Nobody is ever 100% satisfied** with their current stage in life. Every choice comes with tradeoffs—you either **stick with your choice** or **pivot quickly**. The key is accepting your decisions and moving forward with confidence.

### Get Outside More

Spend at least a few hours a day **outside your room**. This increases your chances of running into people, sparking spontaneous interactions, and also gives you an excuse to take a walk—good for both physical and mental well-being.

### **Final Thoughts**

Being a **happy** and **successful** CS major isn't just about grinding through coursework and LeetCode. It’s about **balancing mental health, social relationships, business knowledge, and strategic focus**. Master these, and you’ll **thrive both in college and beyond**.
